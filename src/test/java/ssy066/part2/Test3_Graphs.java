     * Here you will implement the algorithm that creates a Graph. Start by creating a new class that implements the
     * Graph interface and all its methods. You can usually generate empty methods in your IDE. Search for
     * "generate java code from interface eclipse (or intellij)" in google.
     *
     * Your graph is now created in the method GraphFactory.makeMeAGraph.
     *
     * The Graph includes a set of states and a set of transitions. So the method makeMeAGraph should create all
     * transitions and states in the graph and then call the Graph constructor. You have to decide for your self
     * what to send to the graph via the constructor. You can even create extra classes to be used by your graph
     * It is possible to make it with just State and Transition, but if you want to represent the graph in another
     * way, you are free to do so.
     *
     * To make this test pass you have to implement getStates in the Graph class and the constructor.
     *
     * This algorithm is more demanding then what you did in part 1. So divide your code into multiple methods
     * to make it easier. Also write your own tests for those methods. Observe that you method in GraphFactory needs
     * to be public static.
     *
     * The graph in this test are created based on the operation o1 and o2. These are
     * defined at the top of this testfile. We also use testState as initial state. The graph should include,
     * after construction, three states (v1 = 0, v1 = 1 and v1 = 2, the rest of variables have initial value) and
     * two transitions with label "o1" and "o2"
     *
     * Another possibility that I use a lot, is System.out.println(). Use it everytime you need troubleshooting.
     *
     * Also try debugging. Add a line break and run the test in debug-mode and step through
     * your code, line by line.
